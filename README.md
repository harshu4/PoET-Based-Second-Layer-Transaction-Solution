# Blockchain based Payment Solution 

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/gVLmrj5/Untitled-Diagram.jpg)



s** This Was Made During Wiz-a-thon a 24 hours Hackathon **

** Project Description **

As we know currently bank rely on third party such as mastercard and visa for payment \
so we have created a solution using permissioned blockchain that helps banks to run \
there own payment system without compromising security or speed. Even when the bank node
is offline other banks can confirm transaction. 

** Our Aim **
- To make Fast and Secure Payment Solutions that can be adopted Domestically and Internationally

- Without Compromising with security or accessibility

- To make more types of payment method plugable on a single platform

** Some Technical Briefing**\
- Every bank runs it own node , it terms of POW nodes can be reffered to as miners\
- We have used PoET which Utilizes intel's SGX to run code in an trusted environment\
[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/intels-poet-proof-of-elapsed-time-blockchain-consensus-algorithm/ "More About PoET consensus")
- Now Customer Data is Encrypted with Bank's Private key of Whom the customer has account with \
- So No other Bank Can See Sensitive Cusomer Data \
- Many Payment System can be implemented on this bases currently we have unabled Biometric Payment Client\
** How Do to get started **\
- The Whole Codebase is divided into Three Parts \
  - Bank Client\
  - Pos System\
  - Bank Node\

** Tech-Stak Used **\
- Hyperledger Sawtooth\
- Electronjs\
- Some Java and Python\
- Docker\

**Current Code is Buggy **\
- As the whole code was implemented during the 24 hours hackathon this code contains \ 
  some reliance on easy way to code fast, we will refactor it when we get time

**This repository Contains The Code for the Node, Bank Client and POS Client\**
